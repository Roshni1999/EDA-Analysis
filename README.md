# EDA-Analysis

Experiments conducted as part of Advanced BME Lab (AM5019) during December 2021 & January 2022.

## EXPERIMENT: Tonic and phasic response of the skin conductance acquired from a subject viewing a virtual reality simulation.

OBJECTIVE: </br>
i. Record the EDA signal from the skin surface (electrodes placed on the index and middle finger) of an individual subjected to VR. </br>
ii. Filter the EDA signal into tonic and phasic components. </br>
